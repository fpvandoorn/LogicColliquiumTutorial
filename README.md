# Logic Colloquium Tutorial

The Lean tutorial for Logic Colloquium 2023 will be a hands-on tutorial to learn to prove theorems in Lean.

The recommended way for this tutorial is to use Gitpod. This means that Lean will not actually be running on your computer, but on a server remotely. This requires an account on Github, Gitlab or Bitbucket.

* Click this button to get started:

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/fpvandoorn/LogicColloquiumTutorial)

* Then login using an account on Github, Gitlab or Bitbucket, or create a new account if you don't have one yet.

* On the "New Workspace" page, press "Continue".

* Then you have to wait a minute for the remote server to download and install Lean.

* Then open the file `LCTutorial/Introduction.lean`. You can do this from the file explorer, which is the left panel of the screen. If the file explorer isn't shown, you can reveal by clicking the second icon from the icon column on the left, showing two blank pages (just below the settings menu).

### Other ways of using Lean

* Alternatively you could use Github codespaces.

* Alternatively you could install Lean 4.

<!-- After reading the `Introduction.lean` file, you should read explanations and do exercises in the
`Basics` folder, and then choose to work on one file from the `Topics` folder.
Of course you can play with all files from that folder if you have more time. -->

<!-- If you have a lot more time, you should read the book [Mathematics in Lean](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/) (but note that book is currently using the stable version of Lean, Lean 3, whereas this repository uses the brand new Lean 4 which is not yet fully ready for mathematical use). -->

* This tutorial is partly based on [A glimpse of Lean](https://github.com/PatrickMassot/glimpse_of_lean) by Patrick Massot.
