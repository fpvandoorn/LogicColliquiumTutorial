# Logic Colloquium Tutorial

The Lean tutorial for Logic Colloquium 2023 will be a hands-on tutorial to learn to prove theorems in Lean.

There are multiple ways to use Lean.

* The recommended way for this tutorial is to use Gitpod. This requires an account on Github, Gitlab or Bitbucket (which is free to create). Click the button below to get started!

* Alternatively you could use Github codespaces

* Alternatively you could install Lean 4.

<!-- After reading the `Introduction.lean` file, you should read explanations and do exercises in the
`Basics` folder, and then choose to work on one file from the `Topics` folder.
Of course you can play with all files from that folder if you have more time. -->

<!-- If you have a lot more time, you should read the book [Mathematics in Lean](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/) (but note that book is currently using the stable version of Lean, Lean 3, whereas this repository uses the brand new Lean 4 which is not yet fully ready for mathematical use). -->

* This tutorial is for a large part based on A Glimpse of Lean by Patrick Massot.
